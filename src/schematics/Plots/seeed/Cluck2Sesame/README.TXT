Minimum 6mil.

Layers:
-------
All viewed from above, no mirroring.  Solder Resist and Solder Paste Stencil
layers are negatives, all others are positives.

Board Outline:
--------------
All layers contain a zero-width board outline.  Outline size is
4.24016in x 4.20000in and >= 20mil from any feature, copper or otherwise.

Vias and Silkscreen:
--------------------
Some vias are partially covered with silkscreen; this is not anticipated to
be an issue since they should be tented.

Pads and Silkscreen:
--------------------
Some silkscreen map overlap, but this is not an issue.  The silkscreen can be
clipped where necessary, but please advise if this is going to be an issue.

Drill Holes:
------------
All are through-plated and are finished sizes; no adjustments have been made
for plating thickness.  All are >= 20mil from the edge of the board.

Bit sizes can be rounded to the nearest 0.1mm.  Please advise if any drill
sizes are found to be incompatible with your processes.

Annular rings >= 6mil.  Holes >= 0.4mm.
